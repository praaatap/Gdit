## Configuration Setup (One-Time Only)

Before you can use `gdit-sync`, you need to configure it with your own Google API credentials. This is a one-time setup.

### Step 1: Get Google OAuth 2.0 Credentials

1.  Go to the **[Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)**.
2.  If you don't have a project, create a new one.
3.  Click **"+ CREATE CREDENTIALS"** at the top and select **"OAuth client ID"**.
4.  For the "Application type", choose **"Desktop app"** and give it a name (e.g., "gdit-sync-cli").
5.  Click **"Create"**. You will now see a **Client ID** and a **Client Secret**. Keep this window open.

### Step 2: Configure the CLI

Now, run the `setup-creds` command in your terminal. It will ask for the credentials you just generated.

```bash
gdit-sync setup-creds
```

Paste your Client ID and Client Secret when prompted. This will save them securely on your local machine.

### Step 3: Login to Your Google Account

Finally, run the `login` command. This will open your web browser and ask you to authorize the application to access your Google Drive.

```bash
gdit-sync login
```

After you approve the request, you are ready to go!
